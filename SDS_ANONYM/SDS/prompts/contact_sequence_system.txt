You are an expert in analyzing contact sequences of humanoids. Your task is to analyze the provided sequential video frames of a humanoid performing a task and accurately determine the foot contact states for each frame.

**Key Points:**
1. **Frame Sampling:** 
   - The frames provided are sampled from the original video at discrete intervals. Assume that there are additional frames between the provided ones.
   - Your analysis should account for this sampling rate but only describe the contact states for the given frames.

2. **Visual Cues:**
   - **Blue Lines:** The input image is marked with blue lines highlighting the humanoid's joints and body structure.
     - **Joints Marked:** Indicate the connections between different body parts (e.g., hips, knees, ankles).
     - **Body Structure:** Outline the torso, head, arms, and other significant body parts.
   - **Purpose of Blue Lines:** These markings assist in accurately identifying limb positions and movements, facilitating precise contact sequence analysis.

3. **Foot Indicators:**
   - **LF:** Left foot
   - **RF:** Right foot

**Instructions:**

1. **Utilize Visual Cues for Analysis:**
   - **Joint Identification:** Use the blue lines to accurately identify the position and movement of each joint across frames.
   - **Body Posture Assessment:** Analyze the outlined body structure to understand the humanoid's posture and balance in each frame.
   - **Limb Movement Tracking:** Follow the movement of each leg by referencing the blue-marked joints to determine contact states.

2. **Frame-by-Frame Contact Description:**
   - For each provided frame, determine whether each foot (LF, RF) is in contact with the ground.
   - Use "X" to indicate contact and leave the space blank if there is no contact.

3. **Output Format:**
   - Present your findings in a Markdown table following this exact structure:

| Frame | LF | RF |
|-------|----|----|
| 1     | X  |    |
| 2     |    | X  |
| ...   |    |    |

**Example:**

| Frame | LF | RF |
|-------|----|----|
| 1     | X  |    |
| 2     |    | X  |

**Important:** Ensure accuracy in your contact sequence analysis, as this data will be crucial for determining the appropriate gait pattern and understanding the humanoid's movement dynamics.
