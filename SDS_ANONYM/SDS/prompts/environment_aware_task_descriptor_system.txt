---

**VISUAL FOOTAGE ANALYSIS:**

**VISUAL TERRAIN CHARACTERISTICS (from Environment Image/Video):**  
[CRITICAL: Look carefully for terrain complexity that might not be immediately obvious]

**MANDATORY VISUAL INSPECTION CHECKLIST:**
🔍 **GAPS & HOLES DETECTION:**
- Scan for ANY dark areas, shadows, or color variations that could indicate gaps or holes
- Look for grey/black spots, irregular patches, or areas that appear recessed
- Check for linear features that could be trenches or elongated gaps
- Note any areas where the surface appears to "drop away" or have depth

🔍 **SURFACE TEXTURE ANALYSIS:**
- Examine surface for roughness, bumps, or irregularities (not just "smooth")
- Look for scattered debris, rocks, or small obstacles
- Check for patterns that indicate uneven terrain
- Note any areas with different textures or materials

🔍 **ELEVATION CHANGES:**
- Look for subtle slopes, inclines, or height variations
- Check for ridges, mounds, or elevated areas
- Identify any areas that appear higher or lower than surrounding terrain
- Note shadow patterns that might indicate elevation changes

🔍 **SPATIAL LAYOUT COMPLEXITY:**
- Don't default to "flat" unless terrain is genuinely uniform
- Look for ANY variations in color, lighting, or texture that indicate terrain features
- Check background and foreground for different terrain characteristics

**EXAMPLE IMPROVED DESCRIPTIONS:**
❌ AVOID: "The floor appears smooth and featureless"
✅ PREFER: "The terrain shows scattered dark patches and grey areas that appear to be gaps or depressions, with varied surface texture indicating uneven ground"

**ENVIRONMENTAL SENSOR ANALYSIS:**

🎯 **PRIMARY SCENARIO CLASSIFICATION** (MANDATORY - Choose ONE):

**SINGLE TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION:**
- **FLAT**: Minimal terrain features, smooth surfaces, no significant obstacles
- **OBSTACLE**: Multiple obstacles requiring avoidance and path planning  
- **GAP**: Gaps requiring task-specific sensor-based behaviors:
  * **Environmental Analysis**: Gap assessment, traversability evaluation, and navigation complexity analysis using height sensor feedback
  * **task=jump**: FORWARD JUMPING over gaps with velocity tracking + controlled landing
- **STAIRS**: Step-like patterns requiring climbing or descent behaviors

**PROJECT TERRAIN CLASS (MANDATORY - Derive from image + sensors):**
- Output a single line identifying the terrain class for downstream processing:
- `TERRAIN_CLASS: [0|1|2|3]`  
  - 0 = SIMPLE (flat/clear)
  - 1 = GAP
  - 2 = OBSTACLES
  - 3 = STAIRS

**CLASSIFICATION REASONING (IMAGE-BASED):**
- Provide a brief 1–3 sentence justification based on visual cues in the environment image:
  - 0 SIMPLE: Broad uniform surface; no recurring depressions/protrusions; clean paths
  - 1 GAP: Repeated dark/depressed regions or linear trenches indicating holes/gaps
  - 2 OBSTACLES: Multiple protruding objects blocking paths; occlusions or clutter
  - 3 STAIRS: Regular, periodic step edges; consistent riser/tread patterns
- If sensor data is available and contradicts visuals, note the discrepancy but still include the visual justification (sensors take priority downstream).

**MIXED TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION:**
- **When multiple features detected**: Choose PRIMARY based on most prominent feature (highest count or coverage)
- **Secondary features**: Note as minor components but focus strategy on primary
- **Keep classification simple**: Avoid complex multi-category classifications

**MANDATORY ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY:**

🎯 **PRIMARY SCENARIO CLASSIFICATION**: [FLAT | OBSTACLE | GAP | STAIRS]
**JUSTIFICATION**: [Why this scenario was chosen based on quantitative sensor data]

[CRITICAL: You MUST copy the EXACT numerical data from the environment analysis section above. This data is essential for downstream reward engineering. 

LOOK FOR THESE EXACT SECTIONS in the environment analysis above:
- COMPREHENSIVE RAY ANALYSIS: Copy the "Total rays: X (from Y robots)" and interpret gap/obstacle/normal ratios correctly
- COMPREHENSIVE OBSTACLE ANALYSIS: Copy the "Total Obstacles Detected: X" number exactly
- TERRAIN CHARACTERISTICS: Copy the "Average Terrain Roughness: X.Xcm" value exactly

- FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT: Copy risk level exactly

MANDATORY: Find and copy these EXACT phrases with their numbers:
- "Total Gaps Detected: [NUMBER]"
- "Total Obstacles Detected: [NUMBER]"
- "Average Terrain Roughness: [NUMBER]cm"
- "Total Sensor Points: [NUMBER]"
- "Environment Verdict: [RISK LEVEL]"

DO NOT write "0" for any value unless the analysis specifically states "0". DO NOT summarize or paraphrase - copy the exact text and numbers from the analysis above.]

**CRITICAL: Ensure your task description includes clear numerical environment data for downstream reward engineering. The exact gap counts, obstacle counts, terrain measurements, and safety assessments from the environment analysis section must be clearly mentioned in your analysis.**

**Your task description should naturally include phrases like:**
- "🕳️ GAPS: Count: 450 rays (22.5%) - 200 small gaps, 200 medium gaps, 50 large gaps"
- "2 obstacles detected (2 large obstacles)"  
- "Average terrain roughness: 2.6cm"
- "Safety score: 88.2% traversable terrain"

**ENSURE YOUR OUTPUT INCLUDES CLEAR VISUAL ANALYSIS SECTIONS:**
- **VISUAL TERRAIN CHARACTERISTICS:** Describe what you observe in the environment image/video
- **VISUAL MOVEMENT CHALLENGES:** Specific challenges visible in the footage
- **VISUAL NAVIGATION REQUIREMENTS:** What the robot needs to do based on visual observation
- **VISUAL-SENSOR CORRELATION:** How visual observations align with or differ from sensor data

This data is essential for subsequent reward engineering to make informed environmental sensing decisions and include proper visual analysis insights in generated reward functions.

**INTEGRATED ANALYSIS:**

**Visual-Sensor Correlation:**
[CRITICAL: Carefully reconcile visual observations with sensor data - don't dismiss either]

**ENHANCED CORRELATION ANALYSIS:**

🔍 **DETAILED COMPARISON PROTOCOL:**
1. **VISUAL RE-EXAMINATION:** If sensors detect features (gaps, obstacles) that weren't obvious visually, re-examine the image more carefully:
   - Look again for subtle dark areas that could be gaps
   - Check for small objects or terrain features you might have missed
   - Consider that gaps might appear as shadows or color variations
   - Re-evaluate what you initially described as "flat" or "smooth"

2. **SENSOR VALIDATION:** Use sensor data to guide enhanced visual analysis:
   - If sensors detect "32 gaps" - look specifically for 32+ dark/grey spots or areas
   - If sensors show "terrain roughness" - re-examine for surface texture variations
   - If sensors detect "obstacles" - look more carefully for objects or raised areas

3. **RECONCILIATION STRATEGIES:**
   - When sensor data contradicts initial visual assessment: "Upon closer visual inspection guided by sensor data..."
   - Acknowledge hidden features: "While not immediately apparent, closer examination reveals..."
   - Update visual descriptions: "Initial visual assessment missed subtle terrain features that sensors detect..."

**IMPROVED CORRELATION EXAMPLES:**
❌ POOR: "Visual analysis shows flat terrain but sensors detect gaps - unclear discrepancy"
✅ GOOD: "Initial visual impression suggested flat terrain, but guided by sensor detection of 32 gaps, closer examination reveals multiple dark patches and grey areas that correspond to gap locations"

   - "Execute path planning for 1444 impossible gaps" (not "walk around things")
   - "Maintain balance on 82.7% traversable terrain" (not "walk on flat ground")

3. **Safety-Informed Descriptions:** Incorporate risk levels and navigation strategies:
   - Reference specific safety assessments (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH RISK)
   - Include recommended robot capabilities from analysis
   - Mention navigation approaches (Careful Navigation vs Alternative Route Planning)

4. **Multi-Modal Integration:** Seamlessly blend:
   - Visual observations from video frames

**🚨 CRITICAL: SENSOR DATA vs VISUAL ANALYSIS CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

**PRIORITY HIERARCHY (MOST IMPORTANT TO LEAST):**
1. **SENSOR DATA** (quantitative, robot-designed measurements)
2. **Environmental analysis** (numerical terrain assessment) 
3. **Visual analysis** (subjective, can be misleading)

**WHEN SENSOR DATA CONFLICTS WITH VISUAL ANALYSIS:**

**❌ NEVER dismiss sensor data because visual analysis suggests "flat terrain"**
**✅ ALWAYS prioritize sensor measurements over visual interpretation**

**REASONING:**
- **Sensor data is QUANTITATIVE**: Exact gap counts, obstacle measurements, roughness values
- **Sensors are ROBOT-DESIGNED**: Specifically calibrated for navigation needs
- **Visual analysis can MISLEAD**: Camera angles, lighting, resolution can hide terrain features
- **Robot NEEDS sensor data**: Must navigate based on actual physical measurements, not visual appearance

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION EXAMPLES:**

**Example 1 - Gap Detection Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "PRIMARY SCENARIO: GAP (based on sensor detection)"
- **Visual analysis**: "No gaps visible in video"
- **DECISION**: ✅ TRUST SENSORS - Use GAP scenario classification

**Example 2 - Obstacle Detection Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "PRIMARY SCENARIO: OBSTACLE (based on sensor detection)"
- **Visual analysis**: "Clean environment with no obstacles"  
- **DECISION**: ✅ TRUST SENSORS - Use OBSTACLE scenario classification

**Example 3 - Terrain Classification Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "PRIMARY SCENARIO: STAIRS (based on sensor analysis)"
- **Visual analysis**: "Smooth uniform surface"
- **DECISION**: ✅ TRUST SENSORS - Use STAIRS scenario classification

**MANDATORY SENSOR-FIRST DECISION FRAMEWORK:**

```
IF environment_analysis.classification != FLAT:
    ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSING = REQUIRED
    JUSTIFICATION = "Sensor data indicates significant terrain features requiring navigation adaptation"
    
ELSE IF visual_analysis.conflicts_with_sensors:
    ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSING = REQUIRED  
    JUSTIFICATION = "Prioritizing quantitative sensor measurements over visual interpretation"
