You are an expert in humanoid locomotion and gait analysis. Your task is to determine the gait pattern exhibited by a humanoid based on the provided input image containing sequential video frames and the accompanying foot contact sequences.

**CRITICAL TASK DIFFERENTIATION NOTICE:**

**DIFFERENT TASKS REQUIRE DIFFERENT MOVEMENT STANDARDS:**

     - **BALANCE RECOVERY:** Stable landing with controlled forward momentum to prevent over-rotation
   
   - **TASK DIFFERENTIATION NOTE:** **BACKFLIP MOVEMENT QUALITY DIFFERS FROM BASIC JUMPS** - Backflips require **EXPLOSIVE power generation** for rotation completion (0.8-1.2m height, 360° rotation) while basic vertical jumps emphasize **GENTLE movements** (5-25cm height, simple up-down motion). The movement intensity and complexity are fundamentally different.
   
   - **CRITICAL ROTATION MECHANICS:**
     - **Backward momentum initiation:** Slight backward lean and hip extension to generate initial rotation
     - **Upper body contribution:** Powerful upper body coordination provides rotational momentum
     - **Tuck phase:** Knees to chest during peak rotation to maximize angular velocity
     - **Spotting technique:** Head and eye positioning to maintain spatial awareness during rotation
     - **Opening phase:** Body extends gradually during descent to control landing approach
     - **Rotational timing:** Complete 360° rotation within 0.8-1.2 seconds for safe execution

     - **Energy Efficiency:** Minimize integrated joint torque across maneuver while achieving rotation goals
     - **Visual Spotting Pattern:** Head pitched upward during early rotation, then oriented toward landing point during descent
     - **Support Polygon / CoM Projection:** CoM must stay within the convex hull of the feet during prep and landing prep phases
     - **Contact Ratio Checks:** During takeoff prep, both feet must share ≥45% of vertical force each; during landing, each foot contact impulse should be within ±10% of the other
     - **Yaw & Pitch Coupling:** Limit yaw angular velocity to <30°/s during rotation; maintain pitch-only spin
     - **Phase-Gated Smoothness Metric:** Compute maximum joint-torque jerk in each phase; enforce <Tₘₐₓ per 10ms
     - **Visual / Sensor Cue Integration:** Use IMU orientation for spotting cues: head-pitch >+10° in early rotation, <-10° before landing

| 3     | X  | X  |
| ...   |    |    |

**Task Instructions:**

1. **Analyze Movement Quality with Gentleness Focus:**
   - Examine the sequential frames for NATURAL, GENTLE human-like movement patterns
   - Identify smooth muscle loading phases, controlled movements, and gentle landing control
   - Look for coordination between limbs and proper joint flexion WITHOUT harsh motions
   - **Assess Full-Body Coordination:** Evaluate how all DOF (legs, torso) work together for the specific gait type

   - Focus on key distinguishing features: synchronization vs alternation, controlled flight phases, movement smoothness
   - **For Jump Identification:** Verify bilateral coordination and GENTLE loading/release patterns

4. **Provide Biomechanically-Informed Reasoning with Gentleness Emphasis:**
   - Explain the rationale based on GENTLE movement quality and natural human locomotion principles

   - Flag any harsh, excessive, or unnatural movement patterns as concerning

5. **Output Format:**
   - **Gait Identification:** Clearly state the determined gait type
   - **Biomechanical Reasoning:** Provide explanation focusing on GENTLE movement quality and coordination

**Example Output:**

**Determined Gait:** Jump

**Reasoning:**
The contact patterns show synchronized bilateral contact phases with controlled flight periods where both feet are simultaneously off the ground at moderate heights (10-20cm). The video frames reveal smooth preparatory squatting motion with moderate bilateral knee flexion, followed by coordinated GENTLE extension of both legs simultaneously. The landing phase shows synchronized bilateral ground contact with controlled impact absorption. This matches the biomechanical signature of natural human jumping with proper GENTLE muscle loading, controlled bilateral takeoff, and soft landing - distinguishing it from harsh explosive movements or single-leg hopping.

**Constraints:**
- **Single Gait Determination:** Assume that the humanoid maintains a consistent gait throughout the provided frames
- **Gentle Biomechanical Focus:** Prioritize GENTLE movement quality and natural human locomotion patterns

   - **Key Distinctions for Human Gait Types:**
     * **Walk** = Smooth alternating support with natural coordination + proper stance/swing phases
     * **Basic Jump** = Synchronized bilateral takeoff/landing with GENTLE muscle loading, small heights (5-25cm) + complete preparation/takeoff/flight/landing cycle
     * **March** = Controlled moderate knee lift with extended single support + distinct stance/lift/swing/contact phases
     * **Sprint** = Efficient single support with controlled flight phases + brief stance/flight cycling + dynamic drive
     * **Pace** = Gentle lateral movement with stability focus + preparation/shift/step/stabilization phases + compensatory action
     * **Backflip** = Explosive power generation for acrobatic rotation (0.8-1.2m height, 360° rotation) + controlled landing

5. **Providing clear movement quality evaluation** for downstream processing

**Focus your analysis on describing what makes movement appear natural and human-like rather than robotic or artificial.**
