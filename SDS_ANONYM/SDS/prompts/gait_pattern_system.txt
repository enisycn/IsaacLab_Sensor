**CRITICAL MOVEMENT QUALITY PRINCIPLES:**

⚠️ **GENTLE & CONTROLLED MOVEMENT EMPHASIS:**
- ALL gait patterns must prioritize SMOOTH, GENTLE, CONTROLLED movements
- AVOID excessive velocities, heights, or harsh/jerky motions
- Focus on NATURAL human biomechanics with proper muscle loading and release
- Movements should be SUSTAINABLE and energy-efficient, not explosive or extreme
- Emphasize CONTROLLED landing and impact absorption across all gaits

🔄 **NATURAL MOVEMENT PHASES FOR ALL GAITS:**
Every gait pattern consists of NATURAL PHASES that must transition smoothly:

**UNIVERSAL PHASE PRINCIPLES:**
1. **PREPARATION PHASES:** Stable contact, muscle loading, body positioning
2. **TRANSITION PHASES:** Smooth shifts between contact states
3. **EXECUTION PHASES:** Primary movement with appropriate control
4. **RECOVERY PHASES:** Controlled completion, impact absorption, stabilization

**PHASE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Impact Control:** Gentle contact forces during all ground interactions

**GAIT TIMING FUNDAMENTALS (applies to all patterns):**
- **Preparation phases:** 0.2-0.5 seconds (muscle loading, weight positioning)
- **Transition phases:** 0.1-0.3 seconds (contact changes, weight transfers)
- **Execution phases:** 0.3-0.8 seconds (main movement, propulsion)
- **Recovery phases:** 0.2-0.6 seconds (stabilization, landing absorption)

**NATURAL JOINT COORDINATION:**
- **Knee flexion:** Human-like gradual bending for shock absorption during stance, controlled extension for propulsion
- **Hip articulation:** Coordinated yaw, roll, pitch movements for leg orientation and weight transfer
- **Ankle control:** Fine-tuned pitch and roll adjustments for balance and ground contact management

**Example Output:**

**Determined Gait:** Jump

**Reasoning:**
The contact patterns show synchronized bilateral contact phases with controlled flight periods where both feet are simultaneously off the ground at moderate heights (10-20cm). The video frames reveal smooth preparatory squatting motion with moderate bilateral knee flexion, followed by coordinated GENTLE extension of both legs simultaneously. The landing phase shows synchronized bilateral ground contact with controlled impact absorption. This matches the biomechanical signature of natural human jumping with proper GENTLE muscle loading, controlled bilateral takeoff, and soft landing - distinguishing it from harsh explosive movements or single-leg hopping.
