We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked comprehensive training metrics including individual reward components, task performance indicators, training stability measures, and system diagnostics after every {epoch_freq} epochs. The following detailed metrics show training progression with maximum, mean, and minimum values encountered:

Terrain context (if available):
- Include `TERRAIN_CLASS: [0|1|2|3]` from the SUS and a brief 1‚Äì2 sentence image-based rationale.
- Use this solely to contextualize feedback; avoid prescribing reward components.

**üìä ENHANCED TRAINING ANALYSIS:**
The comprehensive metrics below include:
‚Ä¢ Core Performance: Total reward, episode length, reward components
‚Ä¢ Task Metrics: Velocity tracking errors, termination analysis
‚Ä¢ Training Stability: Loss values, action noise, computation performance
‚Ä¢ Safety Indicators: Contact failures, timeout rates
‚Ä¢ System Health: Steps per second, collection/learning times
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ NEW: Environmental Sensing: Terrain variance, robot stability, orientation tracking
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ NEW: Robot Stability: Height consistency, body posture, tracking accuracy

**üåç ENVIRONMENTAL SENSING METRICS:**
‚Ä¢ `terrain_height_variance`: Terrain roughness under robot (lower = smoother terrain)
‚Ä¢ `terrain_complexity_score`: Terrain challenge level (obstacles/gaps/cliffs percentage)
‚Ä¢ `robot_height_baseline`: Robot's median height above terrain (stability indicator)
‚Ä¢ `body_orientation_deviation`: Roll/pitch deviation from upright (lower = more stable)
‚Ä¢ `height_tracking_error`: Accuracy of maintaining target height

This detailed analysis enables precise identification of training issues, reward component effectiveness, performance bottlenecks, environmental challenges, and robot stability issues for targeted improvements.
