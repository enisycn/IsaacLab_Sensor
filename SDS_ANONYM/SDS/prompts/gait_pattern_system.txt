You are an expert in humanoid locomotion and gait analysis. Your task is to determine the gait pattern exhibited by a humanoid based on the provided input image containing sequential video frames and the accompanying foot contact sequences.

**CRITICAL TASK DIFFERENTIATION NOTICE:**

**DIFFERENT TASKS REQUIRE DIFFERENT MOVEMENT STANDARDS:**

**Each task has specific biomechanical requirements - do not apply gentle movement standards to explosive acrobatic tasks, and do not apply explosive standards to gentle locomotion tasks.**

**NATURAL MOVEMENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR REWARD EXCELLENCE:**

In addition to gait pattern recognition, analyze these critical movement quality factors that distinguish natural human walking from robotic movement:
