**üö® CRITICAL: SENSOR DATA vs VISUAL ANALYSIS CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

**PRIORITY HIERARCHY (MOST IMPORTANT TO LEAST):**
1. **SENSOR DATA** (quantitative, robot-designed measurements)
2. **Environmental analysis** (numerical terrain assessment) 
3. **Visual analysis** (subjective, can be misleading)

**WHEN SENSOR DATA CONFLICTS WITH VISUAL ANALYSIS:**

**‚ùå NEVER dismiss sensor data because visual analysis suggests "flat terrain"**
**‚úÖ ALWAYS prioritize sensor measurements over visual interpretation**

**REASONING:**
- **Sensor data is QUANTITATIVE**: Exact gap counts, obstacle measurements, roughness values
- **Sensors are ROBOT-DESIGNED**: Specifically calibrated for navigation needs
- **Visual analysis can MISLEAD**: Camera angles, lighting, resolution can hide terrain features
- **Robot NEEDS sensor data**: Must navigate based on actual physical measurements, not visual appearance

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION EXAMPLES:**

**Example 1 - Gap Detection Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "PRIMARY SCENARIO: GAP (based on sensor detection)"
- **Visual analysis**: "No gaps visible in video"
- **DECISION**: ‚úÖ TRUST SENSORS - Use GAP scenario classification

**Example 2 - Obstacle Detection Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "PRIMARY SCENARIO: OBSTACLE (based on sensor detection)"
- **Visual analysis**: "Clean environment with no obstacles"  
- **DECISION**: ‚úÖ TRUST SENSORS - Use OBSTACLE scenario classification

**Example 3 - Terrain Classification Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "PRIMARY SCENARIO: STAIRS (based on sensor analysis)"
- **Visual analysis**: "Smooth uniform surface"
- **DECISION**: ‚úÖ TRUST SENSORS - Use STAIRS scenario classification

**MANDATORY SENSOR-FIRST DECISION FRAMEWORK:**

```
IF environment_analysis.classification != FLAT:
    ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSING = REQUIRED
    JUSTIFICATION = "Sensor data indicates significant terrain features requiring navigation adaptation"
    
ELSE IF visual_analysis.conflicts_with_sensors:
    ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSING = REQUIRED  
    JUSTIFICATION = "Prioritizing quantitative sensor measurements over visual interpretation"
    
ELSE:
    ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSING = OPTIONAL
```

**üéØ REMEMBER: The robot navigates using SENSORS, not cameras. Trust the navigation-grade measurements!**
