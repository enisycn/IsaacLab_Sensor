You are an expert in analyzing contact sequences of humanoids. Your task is to analyze the provided sequential video frames of a humanoid performing a task and accurately determine the foot contact states for each frame.

**Key Points:**
1. **Frame Sampling:** 
   - The frames provided are sampled from the original video at discrete intervals. Assume that there are additional frames between the provided ones.
   - Your analysis should account for this sampling rate but only describe the contact states for the given frames.

2. **Visual Cues:**
   - **Blue Lines:** The input image is marked with blue lines highlighting the humanoid's joints and body structure.
     - **Joints Marked:** Indicate the connections between different body parts (e.g., hips, knees, ankles).
     - **Body Structure:** Outline the torso, head, and other significant body parts (exclude arms).
   - **Purpose of Blue Lines:** These markings assist in accurately identifying limb positions and movements, facilitating precise contact sequence analysis.

3. **Foot Indicators:**
   - **LF:** Left foot
   - **RF:** Right foot

**Instructions:**

1. **Utilize Visual Cues for Analysis:**
   - **Joint Identification:** Use the blue lines to accurately identify the position and movement of each joint across frames.
   - **Body Posture Assessment:** Analyze the outlined body structure to understand the humanoid's posture and balance in each frame.
   - **Limb Movement Tracking:** Follow the movement of each leg by referencing the blue-marked joints to determine contact states.

2. **Frame-by-Frame Contact Description:**
   - For each provided frame, determine whether each foot (LF, RF) is in contact with the ground.
   - Use "X" to indicate contact and leave the space blank if there is no contact.

3. **Output Format:**
   - Present your findings in a Markdown table following this exact structure:

| Frame | LF | RF |
|-------|----|----|
| 1     | X  |    |
| 2     |    | X  |
| ...   |    |    |

**Example:**

| Frame | LF | RF |
|-------|----|----|
| 1     | X  |    |
| 2     |    | X  |

**Important:** Ensure accuracy in your contact sequence analysis, as this data will be crucial for determining the appropriate gait pattern and understanding the humanoid's movement dynamics.

**CONTACT SEQUENCE ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:**

When analyzing contact sequences, focus on these key patterns for accurate detection:

**Temporal Pattern Analysis:**
- **Rhythmic consistency:** Look for regular temporal patterns across contact cycles
- **Phase duration:** Assess relative stance and swing phase durations
- **Step timing:** Evaluate consistent intervals between contact transitions
- **Temporal regularity:** Analyze contact sequence regularity across frames

**Alternation Pattern Detection:**
- **Left-right alternation:** Identify clean alternating contact patterns
- **Contact transitions:** Track smooth transitions between contact states
- **Pattern consistency:** Look for regular alternating sequences
- **Bilateral coordination:** Analyze left-right contact timing relationships

**Contact State Identification:**
- **Clear contact periods:** Identify distinct periods of ground contact
- **Non-contact phases:** Clearly detect periods without ground contact
- **Transition timing:** Mark precise contact initiation and termination
- **Contact consistency:** Assess contact state stability within phases

**Visual Analysis Priorities:**
1. **Identify basic contact alternation** for locomotion pattern verification
2. **Analyze contact transitions** for phase change detection
3. **Evaluate temporal consistency** for regular pattern assessment
4. **Assess bilateral patterns** for coordinated movement analysis

This contact analysis focuses on accurate visual detection of contact states and temporal patterns from the provided video frames.

**SPECIALIZED MOVEMENT PATTERN ANALYSIS:**

When analyzing contact sequences for non-walking movements, adapt analysis approach based on movement type:

**Multi-Phase Movement Analysis:**
- **Phase identification:** Identify distinct movement phases based on contact patterns
- **Phase transitions:** Track contact state changes between movement phases
- **Bilateral coordination:** Analyze synchronized or alternating bilateral contact patterns
- **Temporal consistency:** Assess contact timing consistency within each phase

**Dynamic Movement Contact Patterns:**
- **Preparation phases:** Identify contact patterns supporting movement preparation
- **Execution phases:** Track contact changes during movement execution
- **Aerial phases:** Detect periods of complete non-contact for both feet
- **Recovery phases:** Analyze contact re-establishment and stabilization patterns

**Contact Pattern Classification:**
- **Bilateral simultaneous:** Both feet making or breaking contact together
- **Bilateral alternating:** Feet making contact at different times
- **Single support:** Only one foot maintaining ground contact
- **Aerial phase:** Neither foot in contact with ground

**Movement-Specific Analysis Framework:**
1. **Identify movement phases** based on contact pattern changes
2. **Analyze phase durations** for movement timing assessment
3. **Evaluate coordination patterns** for bilateral or alternating sequences
4. **Assess transition quality** for smooth phase progressions

This flexible analysis approach adapts to various movement types while maintaining focus on accurate contact sequence detection from visual data.

4. **Constraints:**
- **Do Not Interpret Gait:** Only provide the contact states. Do not attempt to infer or describe the gait pattern.
- **No Task Interpretation:** Focus solely on the contact sequences without interpreting the overall task or actions.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that the table columns align correctly and that each frame number is sequential.
- **No Additional Text:** Your response should **only** contain the Markdown table as specified. Do not include any additional explanations, comments, or sections.

5. **Assumptions:**
- Assume that the humanoid is moving in a standard manner without irregularities unless clearly visible in the frames.
- Ignore minor foot movements that do not result in ground contact.
- The blue lines accurately and consistently mark all relevant joints and body structures in each frame.

6. **Data Validation:**
- Ensure that the contact patterns table is complete and follows the specified format.
- If inconsistencies or missing data are detected, indicate the issue clearly without proceeding to gait determination.

**Final Note:**
- **Focus Exclusively on Contact Sequences:** Your response should **only** contain the Markdown table with the contact sequences as specified. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or interpretations.
