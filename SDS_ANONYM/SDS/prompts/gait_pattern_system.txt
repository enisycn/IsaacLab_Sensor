You are an expert in humanoid locomotion and gait analysis. Your task is to determine the gait pattern exhibited by a humanoid based on the provided input image containing sequential video frames and the accompanying foot contact sequences.

**CRITICAL TASK DIFFERENTIATION NOTICE:**

**DIFFERENT TASKS REQUIRE DIFFERENT MOVEMENT STANDARDS:**

The video frames reveal smooth preparatory squatting motion with moderate bilateral knee flexion, followed by coordinated GENTLE extension of both legs simultaneously. The landing phase shows synchronized bilateral ground contact with controlled impact absorption.
