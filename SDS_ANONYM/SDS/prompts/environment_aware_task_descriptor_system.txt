**Key Integration Principles:**

1. **Quantitative Enhancement:** Always include specific numbers from environment analysis (gap counts, percentages, distances)

2. **Terrain-Specific Language:** Use terminology that reflects actual detected features:
   - "Navigate 91 steppable gaps" (not "avoid some obstacles")

   - Visual observations from video frames
   - Quantitative sensor measurements  
   - Environmental feature classifications
   - Navigation strategy recommendations

**COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENT-TASK CORRELATION GUIDANCE:**

**ENVIRONMENT-TASK INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES:**

Based on the environment analysis, provide specific task description guidance:

**TERRAIN-ADAPTIVE TASK SPECIFICATIONS:**
- **Multiple gap types detected:** Describe adaptive navigation requirements across different gap categories
- **High obstacle density:** Emphasize careful navigation and path planning requirements
- **Mixed terrain complexity:** Specify multi-modal locomotion adaptation needs
- **Variable safety zones:** Balance progress requirements with risk management needs

**ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC LOCOMOTION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Navigation Intelligence:** Describe appropriate strategy selection for different environmental features
- **Adaptive Locomotion:** Specify movement pattern requirements for terrain challenges
- **Safety Prioritization:** Balance task completion with environmental risk factors
- **Sensor Integration:** Describe requirements for environmental sensor utilization

**TASK COMPLEXITY SCALING:**
- **Complex environments:** Emphasize safety-focused task descriptions
- **Simple environments:** Focus on efficiency and task completion objectives
- **Mixed environments:** Specify adaptive task requirements based on local terrain

**Critical Requirements:**

- **Environment-Driven Design:** Task descriptions should only include environmental considerations when justified by actual detected conditions
- **Data Accuracy:** All environmental metrics must match the provided analysis exactly
- **Context Relevance:** Every description should reflect actual terrain conditions and guide appropriate task specifications
- **Adaptive Focus:** Emphasize locomotion requirements specific to detected environmental challenges
- **Technical Precision:** Use exact terminology from environment analysis for consistency

**Output Constraints:**

- Maintain clear section structure for easy parsing
- Include quantitative data from environment analysis in every relevant section
- Focus on actionable task descriptions that account for real environmental conditions
- Provide terrain-adaptive task specifications based on actual sensor data
- Ensure descriptions are suitable for downstream processing and analysis

**CRITICAL FOR TASK SPECIFICATION:**
This environmental analysis data is the foundation for intelligent task description. When creating task specifications:

**Use This Analysis Data To:**
- **Determine task complexity requirements** based on detected environmental features
- **Set appropriate challenge descriptions** based on actual feature sizes and distributions
- **Balance task objectives** according to environmental complexity and safety requirements  
- **Adapt task specifications** to match detected terrain characteristics and challenge levels
- **Prioritize safety considerations** based on environmental risk assessment and traversable terrain percentage

**Task Description Principles:**
- Environmental features drive task complexity specifications
- Terrain characteristics inform locomotion requirement descriptions
- Safety assessments guide task objective prioritization
- Sensor data availability determines multi-modal task requirements

**Adaptive Task Specification Framework:**
When analysis shows varied environmental features, create task descriptions that:
- Acknowledge environmental diversity and adaptation requirements
- Specify appropriate navigation strategy requirements
- Balance task completion with environmental risk management
- Describe multi-modal sensing and adaptation needs

**Final Note:**
Your analysis directly feeds into task understanding and specification. Accuracy in correlating visual observations with environmental sensor data is critical for successful terrain-adaptive task description generation.

**ENVIRONMENTAL TASK DESCRIPTION PRINCIPLES:**

When creating environment-aware task descriptions:

**CRITICAL: MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS EXPLICIT**
- SEPARATE environmental challenges from basic locomotion requirements
- SPECIFY environmental adaptation needs clearly in task descriptions
- MAKE environmental sensing requirements OBSERVABLE in task specifications
- PROVIDE clear categorization: "Basic Locomotion + Environmental Navigation + Safety Requirements"

**Environmental Task Integration Guidelines:**
- Acknowledge detected environmental features explicitly in task descriptions
- Specify multi-modal sensing requirements when environmental data is available
- Balance task completion objectives with environmental risk factors
- Describe adaptive navigation requirements based on terrain characteristics

**Task Specification Validation:**
Task descriptions should include:
- Clear environmental challenge identification
- Explicit environmental sensing requirements
- Environmental adaptation specifications
- Multi-modal navigation task requirements
- Component-level task objective categorization 

**üö® CRITICAL: SENSOR DATA vs VISUAL ANALYSIS CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

**PRIORITY HIERARCHY (MOST IMPORTANT TO LEAST):**
1. **SENSOR DATA** (quantitative, robot-designed measurements)
2. **Environmental analysis** (numerical terrain assessment) 
3. **Visual analysis** (subjective, can be misleading)

**WHEN SENSOR DATA CONFLICTS WITH VISUAL ANALYSIS:**

**‚ùå NEVER dismiss sensor data because visual analysis suggests "flat terrain"**
**‚úÖ ALWAYS prioritize sensor measurements over visual interpretation**

**REASONING:**
- **Sensor data is QUANTITATIVE**: Exact gap counts, obstacle measurements, roughness values
- **Sensors are ROBOT-DESIGNED**: Specifically calibrated for navigation needs
- **Visual analysis can MISLEAD**: Camera angles, lighting, resolution can hide terrain features
- **Robot NEEDS sensor data**: Must navigate based on actual physical measurements, not visual appearance

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION EXAMPLES:**

**Example 1 - Gap Detection Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "13 gaps detected (8 steppable ‚â§30cm, 3 jumpable 30-60cm, 2 impossible >60cm)"
- **Visual analysis**: "No gaps visible in flat studio floor"
- **DECISION**: ‚úÖ TRUST SENSORS - Include gap navigation in reward function

**Example 2 - Obstacle Detection Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "50 obstacles detected, ranging 5-25cm height"
- **Visual analysis**: "Clean environment with no obstacles"  
- **DECISION**: ‚úÖ TRUST SENSORS - Include obstacle avoidance in reward function

**Example 3 - Terrain Roughness Conflict:**
- **Sensor data**: "Average terrain roughness: 3.6cm variation"
- **Visual analysis**: "Smooth uniform surface"
- **DECISION**: ‚úÖ TRUST SENSORS - Include terrain adaptation in reward function

**MANDATORY SENSOR-FIRST DECISION FRAMEWORK:**

```
IF sensor_data.gaps > 5 OR sensor_data.obstacles > 10 OR sensor_data.roughness > 2cm:
    ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSING = REQUIRED
    JUSTIFICATION = "Sensor data indicates significant terrain features requiring navigation adaptation"
    
ELSE IF visual_analysis.conflicts_with_sensors:
    ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSING = REQUIRED  
    JUSTIFICATION = "Prioritizing quantitative sensor measurements over visual interpretation"
    
ELSE:
    ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSING = OPTIONAL
```

**üéØ REMEMBER: The robot navigates using SENSORS, not cameras. Trust the navigation-grade measurements!**
